Main features:
- slider (using JavaScript; images + text carousel, autoplay, next and previous buttons, responsive indicators. Can be used with unlimited number of slides);
- burger menu (using JavaScript; vertically-oriented main menu with a "burger-to-X" animation);
- sticky navbar, and a sub-navbar hiding on scroll down;
- a smooth page transition;
- email addresses with mailto links;
- on-hover animations: navbar underline, shiny buttons, images with filter effect;
- responsive web design.

INFO: This project is intended to demonstrate a one page website layout. Therefore, all the potentially linking elements (apart from the sticky navbar links) are intentionally left inactive.
